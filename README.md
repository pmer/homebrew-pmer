# Paul's Homebrew Tap

These are some personal Homebrew formulae I maintain for personal use.

## Installation

To add this tap and make its formulae available to you:

```
brew tap pmer/pmer
```

All the formulae names are prefixed with `pmer-` for easy recognition.

```
brew remove vim  # If installed...
brew install pmer-vim
```

## Uninstallation

To remove this tap and go back to your previous versions:

```
brew remove pmer-vim
brew untap pmer/pmer
brew install vim  # To reinstall the standard Homebrew version...
```

# Formulae

## pmer-vim

Vim with some modifications I made.
